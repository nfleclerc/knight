/**
 * Created by nathaniel on 4/21/16.
 *
 * This package contains a way for creating new Items. With the removal
 * of the crafting mechanic items no longer serve a purpose and are really only
 * included as novelty things, and only for an aesthetic purpose. Since they no
 * longer hold a purpose, no new items have been made past the original two items
 * made to drop from the Wasp and Spider. These items can still be collected and
 * otherwise function correctly. You just can't do anything with them once you
 * have them.
