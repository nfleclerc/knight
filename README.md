#A Knight of Code

This project uses Apache Ant. Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes
described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other.
The Apache Ant library can be downloaded here: ant.apache.org

Run 'ant run' to build and run the game. 'ant doc' will generate all available documentation.
